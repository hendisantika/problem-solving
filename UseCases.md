## First Case
You are given an array filled with numbers between 1 and n,
inclusive, except that one of the numbers is missing.
Write a function to return the missing number, given that the numbers in the array are in random order.
e.g.
* [1,3,5,4] // your function should return 2
* [2,3,5,4] // your function should return 1
* [1,5,3,2] // your function should return 4

## Second Case
Write a function to find two numbers in an integer array that sum up to a given number x.
e.g.

array = [1,4,6,9,2,3,4,5,9,8,7,2,5,6,8,3,1,4]

x = 15

your function can return (6,9) and (8,7).

## Third Case
You stumble upon a broken password API.
The API "should" only return true when given a string which exactly matches the password.
But it returns true when given a substring of the password. Write a function to deduce the password.

## Fourth Case
Given the digits 123456789, build an expression by inserting "+" or "-" anywhere BETWEEN the digits so that it results to 100.
Your answer should return all possible combinations.

Example: 1 + 23 - 4 + 5 + 6 + 78 - 9 = 100
